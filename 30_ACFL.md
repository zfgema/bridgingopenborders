# Austrian Cultural Forum London

The Austrian Cultural Forum London is an event venue in London which promotes cultural contacts between the UK and Austria by organising, initiating and supporting artists and projects in the fields of music, performing arts, visual arts, literature, film and science. 

The ACF London is the Cultural Section of the Austrian Embassy in London and offers free admission to all of its events, which are organised in cooperation with Austrian and Austrian-based artists. The ACF London arranges, initiates and facilitates about 150 events per year, half of which take place at the ACF’s own premises at 28 Rutland Gate, in the heart of Knightsbridge.

Austrians feel passionately about their identity as a Kulturnation (cultural nation). At a time when issues of national identity are hotly debated, we contribute to this discussion with a contemporary programme that goes beyond stereotypes. 

This will be the second year we participate, together with our partner Ars Electronica, in the V&As Digital Design Weekend. As a cultural institution we are particularly interested in working with partner institutions in both Austria and the UK and the DDW provides us with the ideal opportunity to shine a spotlight on the achievements of Austrian artists in this field. 

This year we have expanded our presentation of Austrian digital arts with a dedicated programme of events, projects and exhibitions across the fields of digital, electronic and sound art and experimental film. The Unconscious Archives Festival will feature a special Austrian arts focus and our in-house exhibition Emotion + the Tech(no)body presents Austrian and UK-based artists whose works consider our cultural and emotional attachment to data and the relationship of our bodies to technology. The exhibition features artists working across sound art, experimental film, software programming, laboratory culture, sculpture, ephemeral art, instrument building and post internet art. This season we invite you to join us in celebrating the best of digital and sound art from Austria.
